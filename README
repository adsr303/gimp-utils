This is a repo for my personal GIMP-related stuff, mostly scripts.
You may find it useful or not. :)

Scripts:

adsr-highpass-sharpen.scm
  High-pass sharpening algorithm based on multiple tutorials. Creates
  a sharpening overlay that can be adjusted, moved around and otherwise
  modified for user preference.

adsr-split-toning.scm
  Split-toning algorithm based on a tutorial. I like the colors better
  than other similar scripts and there are some extra options.

adsr-bw-films.scm
  Simulates light response of various black-and-white films. Based on an
  article on the web. There is another implementation in GIMP Registry
  but I decided to keep this one because it shows a more elegant, I hope,
  way of coding this. :)
